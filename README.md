gaborjets
=========
Java code for computing "Gabor Jet" features from images. The included example shows how to track features across two included images. 
Based on Matlab code from [Xiaomin Yue](http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~xiaomin/). Depends on Piotr Wendykier's [JTransforms](https://sites.google.com/site/piotrwendykier/software/jtransforms) (included, but outdated).
